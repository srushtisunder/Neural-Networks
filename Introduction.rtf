\f0\fs24 \cf0 The project is about depicting a sub area and understanding what label it belongs to out of the 7 given. Each data set is a 3X3 square neighbourhood of pixels that combine to form the 82X100 sub area. Due to security reason some data is removed so that the original image cannot be reconstructed. Regardless, this serves as a fantastic to opportunity to learn and implement Neural Networks as we\'92ve learnt it. }
