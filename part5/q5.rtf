\f0\fs24 \cf0 With 2 hidden layers, the Network took more time in achieving ideal weights and biases. Even though there were more layers and hence more neurons, the accuracy wasn\'92t affected much. This could be because this problem doesn\'92t necessarily need a 4 layered complex Network due to it\'92s simple and straightforward classification problem. We chose 3 layers to keep the run time as low as possible.}
