\f0\fs24 \cf0 More Neurons results in more run time due to more biases and weights that need to be tweaked on every epoch. An ideal number of neurons would be as low as possible and should converge quickly as well. Since training error graph isn\'92t getting that significantly affected, we chose 10 as the ideal number of neurons. This way the run time remains low and the algorithm is accurate and efficient at the same time.}
